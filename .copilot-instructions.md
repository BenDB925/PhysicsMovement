# Copilot Agent Instructions — PhysicsDrivenMovementDemo

> Auto-read by Copilot/Claude on every session. Optimised for agents, not humans.

## Project Summary

Multiplayer ragdoll brawler (Gang Beasts–style). 2–4 players control physics-driven active-ragdoll characters that grab, punch, throw, and knock each other out. Built in **Unity 6 (6000.0.33f1, Built-in 3D RP)** with **Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)** for peer-to-peer networking. Characters are *always* ragdolls — muscle forces (ConfigurableJoint SLERP drives) keep them upright; zeroing those forces *is* the ragdoll/knockout state. Physics is host-authoritative at 100 Hz.

- **Clients** read input and send via `ServerRpc`. They do NOT apply physics forces (unless local prediction is added later).
- **Host** runs PhysX, applies all forces, owns all Rigidbody authority.
- **NetworkRigidbody** replicates transform state to clients. Core bodies (hips, torso) sync at 30 Hz; extremities at 15 Hz.

## Key Constraints & Decisions

| Constraint | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Always-ragdoll | No kinematic mode. "Standing" = joint drives active. "Knocked out" = joint drives zeroed. |
| Host-authoritative physics | Avoids desync. Clients are visual-only for physics objects. |
| Primitives first | Characters are capsules/boxes until physics feel is right. Art comes last (Phase 7). |
| 100 Hz physics | `Time.fixedDeltaTime = 0.01f`. Required for joint stability with 15-body ragdolls. |
| PD balance (no I term) | Integral term causes windup with ragdolls. Use Proportional + Derivative only. |
| Layer-based self-collision filtering | Each player has a dedicated physics layer. `RagdollSetup` also calls `Physics.IgnoreCollision` for neighbouring parts. |

## Project-Specific Rules (Extend CODING_STANDARDS.md)

1. **All physics tuning parameters** (`kP`, `kD`, joint springs/dampers, force magnitudes, speed caps) must be `[SerializeField]` with `[Range]` attributes — never hardcoded literals.
2. **Joint configuration data** (angle limits, drive springs, mass) should live in ScriptableObjects or serialized structs so ragdoll variants are data-driven.
3. **Do not set `Rigidbody.velocity` directly** for gameplay movement. Use `AddForce` / `AddTorque` with appropriate `ForceMode`. Velocity clamping via `ClampMagnitude` is acceptable as a safety cap only.
4. **State machine transitions** must be explicit and logged at `Debug.Log` level during development (guarded by a `[SerializeField] bool _debugStateTransitions`).
5. **Networking guard pattern** — every `NetworkBehaviour` method that applies gameplay logic must be guarded:
   - Input reading: `if (!IsOwner) return;`
   - Physics / state mutation: `if (!IsServer) return;`
   - Visual-only client effects: `if (IsServer) return;`

## Phase Status Tracker

Update this section as phases are completed so future agents know the current state.

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 — Project Setup | **Complete** | Unity 6000.0.33f1, packages added, physics configured, layers 8–12 set, folder structure created. |
| 1 — Ragdoll Skeleton | **Scripts written** | `RagdollSetup.cs` done. `RagdollBuilder` Editor tool creates prefab — run via Tools menu. Tests written and passing. Pending: open Unity, run `Tools → Build Player Ragdoll`, drop-test prefab. |
| 2 — Balance Controller | Not started | |
| 3 — Locomotion | Not started | |
| 4 — Grabbing & Combat | Not started | |
| 5 — Networking | Not started | |
| 6 — Game Loop & UI | Not started | |
| 7 — Polish & Juice | Not started | |

## Quick Workflow Reminder

Every task follows **CODING_STANDARDS.md §1** — the six mandatory phases:

```
A. Understand → B. Comment Design → C. Write Tests (red) → D. Implement (green) → E. Verify → F. Self-Review (F1–F10 checklist)
```

Present the F1–F10 self-review table to the user before committing. See `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §1 Phase F for the full checklist.

Run tests from the terminal using the commands in `AGENT_TEST_RUNNING.md`. Do not ask the user to open the Test Runner window.

*Update this file whenever systems, namespaces, architecture, constraints, or phase status change.*
